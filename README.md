## User Stories

## MVP
1. As a user, I want to view the images on the page so that I can browse the photo collection.
2. As a user, I want to be able to filter the images so that I can view only images that match a keyword.
3. As a user, I want a simple, clean looking UI so that my photo gallery clearly displays the images in a grid like pattern.

1. I got most of the features done, the only thing i didnt get done was some styling. The issue I had was getting the sort to display only the title when the images was also displyed.
